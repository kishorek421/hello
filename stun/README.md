A STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) server is a tool used in network protocols to assist with the traversal of Network Address Translators (NAT) and firewalls, commonly used in peer-to-peer (P2P) communication. Here’s a brief overview:

### What is a STUN Server?

1. **Purpose**:

   - It allows a device located behind a NAT (such as a home router) to discover its public IP address and the type of NAT it is behind.
   - Helps in establishing a UDP connection between two devices located behind NATs.
2. **How it Works**:

   - A client sends a request to the STUN server.
   - The server responds with the public IP address and port of the client.
   - This information is used by the client to communicate with another client.

### Key Components and Functions

1. **NAT Discovery**:

   - Identifies the external IP address and port mappings created by the NAT for the client’s connections.
2. **Binding Request**:

   - The client sends a binding request to the STUN server.
   - The server responds with the client's public IP address and port.
3. **Binding Response**:

   - Contains the public IP address and port where the server received the request from.
4. **NAT Types**:

   - Full-cone NAT
   - Restricted-cone NAT
   - Port-restricted cone NAT
   - Symmetric NAT
