Python Starter

### 1. Variables and Data Types

**Variables** are used to store data. Python is dynamically typed, so you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create it.

```python
# Integer
x = 5

# Float
y = 3.14

# String
name = "Alice"

# Boolean
is_student = True
```

### 2. Basic Data Structures

**Lists** are ordered collections of items.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
```

**Tuples** are similar to lists but are immutable (cannot be changed).

```python
coordinates = (10, 20)
print(coordinates[1])  # Output: 20
```

**Dictionaries** are collections of key-value pairs.

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice
```

**Sets** are collections of unique items.

```python
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4}
print(numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

### 3. Control Structures

**Conditional Statements** allow you to execute code based on conditions.

```python
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x == 0:
    print("x is zero")
else:
    print("x is negative")
```

**Loops** allow you to repeat code multiple times.

```python
# For loop
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# While loop
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

### 4. Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code.

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### 5. Classes and Objects

Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. You can create classes to define objects.

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def bark(self):
        return "Woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Woof!
```

### 6. Importing Modules

Python has a rich standard library and you can also install third-party modules using pip.

```python
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
```

### 7. File Handling

You can read from and write to files.

```python
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)  # Output: Hello, world!
```

### 8. Exception Handling

You can handle errors using try-except blocks.

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
```
